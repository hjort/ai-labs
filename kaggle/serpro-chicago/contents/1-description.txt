Chicago Crime Rate - Uses weather and city statistics to compare arrest rates with the total crimes for each category.

Approximately 10 people are shot on an average day in Chicago.

How has crime changed over the years? Is it possible to predict where or when a crime will be committed? Which areas of the city have evolved over this time span?

What categories of crime exhibited the greatest year-over-year increase between 2015 and 2016?
Which month generally has the greatest number of motor vehicle thefts?
How does temperature affect the incident rate of violent crime (assault or battery)?

This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. This data includes unverified reports supplied to the Police Department. The preliminary crime classifications may be changed at a later date based upon additional investigation and there is always the possibility of mechanical or human error. Therefore, the Chicago Police Department does not guarantee (either expressed or implied) the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information and the information should not be used for comparison purposes over time.

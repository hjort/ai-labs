DepTime:	actual departure time (stored as decimal float, for example, 12:45 is stored as 12.75)
CRSDepTime:	scheduled departure time (stored as decimal float, for example, 12:45 is stored as 12.75)

Arrival Performance
ArrTime:	actual arrival time (stored as decimal float, for example, 12:45 is stored as 12.75)
CRSArrTime:	scheduled arrival time (stored as decimal float, for example, 12:45 is stored as 12.75)

Airline
UniqueCarrier:	carrier ID. When the same code has been used by multiple carriers, a numeric suffix is used for earlier users, for example, PA, PA(1), PA(2).
